# constructor-word-guess

## Purpose
This is a class project to demonstrate my ability to create and interact with constructors using node. 

## Overview
This repository utilizes node to play a word guess game. A random word is chosen from words.txt and passed into Word.js and Letter.js constructors to handle it's state of being guessed and display relevant information to the user using inquirer to allow them to guess letters for the word. Upon completion, win or lose, the user is prompted with the choice to play another round.
